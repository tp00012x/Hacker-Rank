# We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).
#
# Let's try to understand this with an example.
#
# You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.
#
# Example
#
# >>> string = "abracadabra"
# You can access an index by:
#
# >>> print string[5]
# a
# What if you would like to assign a value?
#
# >>> string[5] = 'k'
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
# How would you approach this?
